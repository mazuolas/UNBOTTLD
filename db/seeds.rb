  description: "The perfect balance of Retribution Imperial Stout and Devil’s Milk Barleywine, Devil’s Due is black, full-bodied, and smoothly drinkable. Its seductive swirl of dark chocolate, coffee, smoky malt, and citrus fruit flavors, infused with notes of charred oak, vanilla and caramelized sugar, disguises a strong, warming alcohol presence (11% abv) that reminds those who dance with the Devil that eventually, a price will be paid.",

  description: "The traditional American Wheat Ale serves as a solid baseline, but we couldn’t be content until we tore the roof off this sucker! Funk, our Blueberry Citrus Wheat Ale, sets the rhythm with a soulful fusion of American wheat and hops, before unleashing a stunning encore with big notes of blueberry and Meyer lemon. It’s no jive, you’ll just dig it!",
