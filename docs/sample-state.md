      description: "The perfect balance of Retribution Imperial Stout and Devil’s Milk Barleywine, Devil’s Due is black, full-bodied, and smoothly drinkable. Its seductive swirl of dark chocolate, coffee, smoky malt, and citrus fruit flavors, infused with notes of charred oak, vanilla and caramelized sugar, disguises a strong, warming alcohol presence (11% abv) that reminds those who dance with the Devil that eventually, a price will be paid."
